    beginning:
        'In my teenage years at school I had a lesson about html. I caught on quick and that instantly fascinated me. Ever since I have had a passion for web development. I taught myself every single day after school and started building websites. I remember using tons of Dreamweaver back in the day which sounds so funny right now, when pure code is so beautiful and elegant. Due to youth and lack of knowledge of studies selection I did however put aside that passion and changed my path completely by going to study international business.',
    university:
        'At my university years I grew around friends that were playing poker. Mathematics, psychology and intensity of that game began to interest me. Long story short - I got into it and since then I have been a professional poker player for almost a decade. The game and intense everyday competition taught a lot and matured me not only as a player, but as a person as well. Every single day I have to maintain work ethics and mindset at the highest level possible.',
    turningPoint:
        'I did very well for myself but was never crazy about poker. I was always searching for a new challenge where I can get myself into and get extremely mad and excited about. But decent income and comfortable life kept holding me back. At least until August 2018, when I bought a course on Udemy to exercise my mind and educate myself during freetime. The first minute into the course I unexpectedly felt all the emotions I was searching for. I was insanely happy and couldnt stop learning. It has become my addiction. Since then I didnt turn back even once. This is true passion, this is what I love and this is what I want to devote my life to.',
    objectives:
        'I am eager to learn and improve my code every single day. And im excited to grow as a developer. Unfortunately all of my skills are at the very beginning level. Which is obvious after learning and practicing only for a couple of months. Nevertheless I can offer the desire to go extra mile, high level work ethics, hunger to improve daily and relentless passion for web development.'
